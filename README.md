# ☁️ Here is a basic Serverless AWS Application ☁️

This is a serverless application built with Node.js and AWS Lambda. It provides a basic example of how to create serverless functions using AWS Lambda and API Gateway.

## Prerequisites

Before running or deploying this application, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Node.js (version 12.x or later)
- AWS account and IAM credentials
- Serverless Framework (installed globally)

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to get started with the application:

1. Clone the repository:

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install

3. Configure AWS credentials:

Set up your AWS IAM credentials by either configuring the AWS CLI using `aws configure` or setting the environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.

4. Update serverless.json:

Update the `serverless.json` file in the project root to customize the service name, region, and other settings as needed.

5. Deploy the application:
   ```bash
    sls deploy

6. Test the application:

Once the deployment is complete, you will see the API endpoints generated by API Gateway in the console output. Use the provided endpoints to test the application.

## Function Structure

The application follows a simple directory structure:

- `src/functions/`: Contains the individual function directories.
- `src/functions/hello/`: Contains the function code for the "hello" function.
